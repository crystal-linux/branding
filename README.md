## Branding Guidelines

The following section will describe the guidelines we ask to be enforced when designing media for or about the Crystal Linux distribution. You are under no legal obligation to follow these rules, but following them will result in a cleaner, more consistent look, in line with what we are making for official media.

## Naming

Following our rebranding from "CrystalUX" to "Crystal", we asked to be referred to as such. "Crystal Linux" and "the Crystal Linux distribution" are also applicable in situations where "Crystal" would be too broad or confusing of a term.

## Use of Logo

We ask for the Crystal logo to only be used when relating to Crystal. The logo should not be used in the context of another Linux distribution, Linux as a whole, nor any unrelated ideas/purposes.

## Colours

We ask for the following colours to be used for any media on/about Crystal or in relation to it: 

###### Logo:

- ![#A900FF](https://via.placeholder.com/15/A900FF/000000?text=+) `#A900FF`
- ![#535353](https://via.placeholder.com/15/535353/000000?text=+) `#535353`
 
###### Background: 

- ![#2B2B2B](https://via.placeholder.com/15/2B2B2B/000000?text=+) `#2B2B2B`

###### General Colour Scheme:

- ![#000000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/000000/000000?text=+) `#000000`
- ![#A900FF](https://via.placeholder.com/15/A900FF/000000?text=+) `#A900FF`
- ![#E4E4E4](https://via.placeholder.com/15/E4E4E4/000000?text=+) `#E4E4E4`
 - ![#0084FF](https://via.placeholder.com/15/0084FF/000000?text=+) `#0084FF`
- ![#535353](https://via.placeholder.com/15/535353/000000?text=+) `#535353`
- ![#2B2B2B](https://via.placeholder.com/15/2B2B2B/000000?text=+) `#2B2B2B`

## Fonts

Typically, for official graphics we prefer to use [Open Sans](https://github.com/googlefonts/opensans) and [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato)
